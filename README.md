Crypto_Clustering.ipynb and crypto_market_data.csv

### Introduction
The Cryptocurrency Clustering Analysis project aims to provide an insight into the cryptocurrency market by grouping similar cryptocurrencies. The project employs K-means clustering algorithm and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pandas
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
HoloViews
hvPlot

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/Crystal-Rosenbrook/cryptoclustering.git```

Navigate to the project directory:
```cd your_project_name```

Install the required packages:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Usage
Load your data by replacing crypto_market_data.csv with your own dataset. Make sure that the dataset contains at least coin_id, price_change_percentage_24h, and price_change_percentage_7d columns.

Run the main Python script to perform the clustering analysis:
```python main_script.py```

Observe the plotted graphs for the Elbow Method to determine the optimal value of K for clustering.

Check out the clustered cryptocurrencies visually in the scatter plot.
